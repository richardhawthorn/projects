### Description

I found a few chunks of walnut at a local hardare shop and realised they would be perfect for making bottle openers. I would laser engrave lettering on the front, add a bottle opener at the top and add a magnet around the back to catch the falling bottle caps.
<br/><br/>
I started by routing out 2 mounting screw holes in the back, and a space for the magnet at the back, these were done by hand as I didn't need them to be perfect. 
<br/><br/>
I then sanded the front and sides by hand before laser engraving the lettering on the front.  I was making two for friends at Christmas, so I engraved a J (for Jones) and F (for Farrer).
<br/><br/>
After the laser engraving I oiled up the wood let it dry, then applied 3 layers of polyurethane over 2 days, very lightly sanding in between layers.
<br/><br/>
Once that was dry I screwed the bottle opener onto the front, added the mounting screw clips on the back, and used a glue gun to fix the magnet in around the back.
<br/><br/>
The presents went down well, and the opener work as expected, catching the bottle caps as they fell.
