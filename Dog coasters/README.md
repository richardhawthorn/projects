### Description

Another Christmas present, this time for friends with a bulldog.
<br/><br/>
Using some 3mm walnut I found locally, I used the Cambridge Hackspace laser cutter to engrave and then cut out the coasters.
<br/><br/>
I sanded carefully, making sure I didn't sand where the laser had engraved the bulldog.  I oiled up the wood, bringing out the colour, really improving the look.
<br/><br/>
3 layers of polyurethane later and they were almost finished, I just needed to attach the silicone feet to complete them.
